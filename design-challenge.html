						<p class="info">Questions that will aid in the route I am going to take to redesign Lula's website.</p>
					</header>
					<p> 
						What is the problem you are trying to solve?<br>
							Show through the website in a more impactful way the mission and goals of Lula's Coffee Company as well as make the site easier to use. <br>
						1)The Design Question<br>
							How can this website make people want to buy coffee from Lulas to support missions?<br>
						2)The Ultimate Impact<br>
							To bring more awareness and money to the mission work that Lulas is working with.<br>
						3)Possible Solutions<br>
							-Make mission statement more apparent<br>
							-High quality images<br>
							-More functional and aesthetic website design<br>
							-More personal and genuine feel to the site<br>
							-Different set of hierachy<br>
						4)Context and Constraints<br>
							Lulas is targeted towards students and workers. Use this idea when coming up with marketing and design strategies. Make is easily navagational, but also aesthetic. <br>
						5)The Design Question (restated)<br>
							How can the way I design and project the mission of this site create a want in people to buy their coffee from Lulas?<br>
