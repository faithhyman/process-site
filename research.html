                    <p>Lula's is a small locally owned coffee company in Florence South Carolina. The opened shop in 2012, and has since opened a second location about 15 minutes down the road from the first. They host events with guest speakers, have open mic nights on Thursdays, and bring a light to the Florence community.</p>

                    <h2>What The Lulas Brand Advocatess For</h2>
                    <p>Lulas brand was founded on the principle of mission work. This article goes a little more into what exactly those missions are rooted in, unlike any of thier social media pages. This, in my opinion, needs to change.</p>

                    <h2>Ownership</h2>
                    <p>The mission statement of Thread and Compass, the company that owns Lulas, is the same as Lula's statement. This push towards missions is an important addition that I want to be sure to highlight and make known in the new site. </p>

                    <h2>Events</h2>
                    <p>To bring more people in, Lulas started to do weekly/ monthly events that were and are super successful. This is a great starting point, and a great thing to include and implement into thier website as a means to bring people in. The age range I am pushing my marketing to woud love events and things like this.</p>
