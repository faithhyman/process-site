                    <p>The images above are what the website currently stands at.</p>
                    <p>Lula's is a small locally owned coffee company in Florence South Carolina. The opened shop in 2012, and has since opened a second location about 15 minutes down the road from the first. They host events with guest speakers, have open mic nights on Thursdays, and bring a light to the Florence community.</p>

                        <h1>Secondary Research</h1>
                    <h2>Answer The Basics</h2>
                    <p>1. Below I discuss the opening of the new location, the inclusion of events, etc as some of the most recent news.<br>
                    2. Culturally, it is very popular for coffee companies to have aesthetics as a main focus of their brand and site. I discuss this aspect in talking about the age range which I am pushing these marketing strategies to.<br>
                    3. There is also another similar company in the area, Soule. Soule also had an open mic night, but not many other things. Soule ended up closing down due to covid. I believe the family environment and mission driven statement of Lula's is what kept it in business and even open another location during covid. For this reason, I really want to double down on this direction to take the site. Make sure it's known that it is a place for families, for friends, for the WHOLE community... though keep in my mind that there is a specific age range that is more likely to come and spread the word about it.<br> 
                    4.I was not able to find any market data concerning Lulas.

                    <h2>What The Lulas Brand Advocates For</h2>
                    <p>Lulas brand was founded on the principle of mission work. This article goes a little more into what exactly those missions are rooted in, unlike any of thier social media pages. This, in my opinion, needs to change.</p>

                    <h2>Ownership</h2>
                    <p>The mission statement of Thread and Compass, the company that owns Lulas, is the same as Lula's statement. This push towards missions is an important addition that I want to be sure to highlight and make known in the new site. </p>

                    <h2>Events</h2>
                    <p>To bring more people in, Lulas started to do weekly/ monthly events that were and are super successful. This includes unlimited pancakes on the first Saturday of every month, and open mic night. This is a great starting point, and a great thing to include and implement into thier website as a means to bring people in. The age range I am pushing my marketing to woud love events and things like this and this needs to be an important part of thier site.</p>
