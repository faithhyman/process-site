						<p class="info">After researching, here is what I came up with in the end.</p>
					</header>
					<p>Through trial and error, I came up with an ending solution for how I want the theme and overall aesthetic of Lulas site redesign to be. <br>
					With the classes critique, I was able to take a step back from my work and make finishing touches and changes to it. </p>

					<p>The main changes that I made were to make more obvious what the company was on the home screen. I chose a color pallete with peaceful, warm colors to match the adjectives and vibe that I was going for. The words are "peaceful, full-hearted, lively, homey, and humble". I chose didot and avenir as my two typefaces. Didot goes along with the simple yet elegant nature of the shop, so I felt that it paired really nicely with the site. Avenir looks super professional and legible. I also shrunk the monkey logo in the top right down and tried different colors, but stuck with black because it looked the best. </p>
