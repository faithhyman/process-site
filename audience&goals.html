						<h1>Digging a little deeper on the audience.</h1>
                    <p>Attached below is an organized list of the people directly involved, the people associated with those people, the fans of the company, and the skeptics. This will aid in my narrowing down and understanding the 5 w's of Lulas; the who, what, when, where, and why.</p></header>
			

			<!--AUDIENCE & GOALS: EXAMPLE FORMATTING-->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sticky1.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>This is the overview of the ways I categorized the people who would be going to lulas, whether it be directly knowing the company, or hearing about it from someone else. It also elaborates on the people who would be fans/ supports of the company as well as the skeptics.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sticky2.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>For the first category I made a list for <br> <i>Directly Involved</i>
                        <br>
                            These are the people that are in the middle of the organization... the people buying the coffee, as well as those who are benefited due to those purchases. 
                            I then split this category into two more categories of <br> <i>Impacted</i> and <i>Impactors</i> <br>
                            
                            Impacted are the people who would be helped, such as those in need in the community, those who have been through natural disasters, missionaries around the world, etc. Impactors are who you would find in the coffee shop, or those who would help to increase the amount of people impacted. This would be people such as teenagers, college students, volunteers, church groups, mission minded individuals, and coffee lovers/ overall supporters of the Lula's brand.  
						 </p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sticky3.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
                    <p>This category is those who would be associated with the people directly involved such as friends, family, etc. <br>
                        Each of those "impactors" I came up with a list of people or groups that would be associated with them and would come to Lulas because of that. 

                    </p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/sticky4.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
                    <p>The last section is the "fans" and the "skeptics". I stated that the fans would be people who have a passion for helping others and making a positive impact on others. The skeptics would probably be people who are not sure of the exact missions being done, due to the fact that they are very vague on their site and social media pages.</p>
