					<p>This is the overview of the ways I categorized the people who would be going to lulas, whether it be directly knowing the company, or hearing about it from someone else. It also elaborates on the people who would be fans/ supports of the company as well as the skeptics.</p>

					<p>For the first category I made a list for <br> <i>Directly Involved</i>,
                        <i><br>
                            These are the people that are in the middle of the organization... the people buying the coffee, as well as those who are benefited due to those purchases. 
                            I then split this category into two more categories of <br> <i>Impacted</i> and <i>Impactors</i> <br>

					<p>I soon found that there were some audiences that fit into multiple categories. I wanted to cover
						all my bases, so I wedged them between columns to show interchangability. It was hard narrowing
						them down even further and deciding which section of the determined audience would fit best.</p>

					<p>When it came down to refining my audience in this exercise, I focused on the categories
						<i>Audience (as an Organization)</i> and <i>Audience (Consumers/Earth Market)</i>. I found that
						these two categories directly represented the main audience I wanted to reach.</p>
